# Hola!

My name's Seungwan, Kwon. I'm majoring in information security at Korea Univ as undergrad student. I currently play CTF as a member of the CyKor and participate in several dev&research projects.

This archive is mainly for my studying records which would be about basic CS knowledge to cutting-edges.

Here are fields of computer science that I'm now interested in:

- Operating System
- Aritificial Intelligence
- Software Security

I like to understand in anatomic detail, and I want to share my understanding as easily as possible. Hence, most of the articles would contain rich examples, implementations, and enough descriptions.

My English skill could be a bottle-neck of this writing activity, but it would be better soon; as far as I knowðŸ˜…. If you find any awkward sentence or wrong information, please tell me. That would be kind of you, and I would really appreciate. You can reach me at  hhro9712@gmail.com.

Then, enjoy my memoryðŸ§ .
