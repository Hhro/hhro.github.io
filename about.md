Hola! My name's Seungwan, Kwon. I'm majoring in information security at Korea Univ as undergrad student. I currently play CTF as a member of the CyKor and participate in several dev&research projects.

This archive is mainly for my studying records which would be about basic CS knowledge to cutting-edges.

Here are fields of computer science that I'm now interested in:

- Operating System
- Aritificial Intelligence
- Software Security

I like to understand in anatomic detail, and I want to share my understanding as easily as possible. So I would try to include rich examples, implementations, and enough descriptions.

If you want to contact me, you can reach me at hhro9712@gmail.com

Then, enjoy my memoryðŸ§ .
