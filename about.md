## Introduction

Hi, my name's Seungwan Kwon(a.k.a. hhro), and I graduated in cyber defense from Korea University.

I'm currently playing CTF as a member of the CyKor and working for the [Theori](https://theori.io/).

This blog is for my studying records of computer science, security, and whatever I learned.

Here are the topics I'm now interested in:

- Software Security
- Reverse Engineering
- Aritificial Intelligence

I like to understand in anatomic detail, and I want to share my understanding easily. So I would try to include rich examples, implementations, and enough descriptions.

If you want to contact me, you can reach me at hhro9712@gmail.com
